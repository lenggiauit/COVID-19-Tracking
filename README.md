# COVID-19-Tracking
COVID-19 Tracking project. 

Technologies: .Net Core 3x, React TypeScript, Redux Toolkit - RTK Query, React Bootstrap.

I want to develop this application because I want to see quickly report from WHO. Currently, the report from WHO very slow because they have lots of data but I want to see some overview report from special region or country only. I build a schedule task to get data from WHO API, process and convert data to model in my API and save them to cache.The schedule task will run everyday to make sure all data is up to date.
