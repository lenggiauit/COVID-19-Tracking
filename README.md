# COVID-19-Tracking
COVID-19 Tracking project. Technoligies: .Net Core 3x, React Type Script.
I want to develop this application because I want to see quickly report from WHO. Currently report from WHO very slow because they have lots of data but I want to see same overview report from special region or country only. I build a schedule task to get data from WHO API, process and convert it to model in my API and save them to cache.
